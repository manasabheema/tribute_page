                <h3 style="text-align:center; margin:50px 0;">Here's a time line of Captain Vikram Batra:</h3>
        
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1974</strong> - He was bron in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh to Girdhari Lal Batra (father) and
                        Kamal Kanta (mother)</li>
                    <li><strong>1996</strong> - He joined IMA in the Manekshaw Battalion</li>
                    <li><strong>1997</strong> - He graduated from IMA after completing his 19-month training and was
                        commissioned as a Lieutenant into the 13th Battalion, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles</li>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong> - He was ordered by Battalion, 13 JAK RIF to move to Dras, Jammu, and Kashmir</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - He is known as the Hero of the Kargil War and was instrumental in recapturing
                        Peak 5140 and overlooks the Tololing nullah. During the mission, he chose 'Yeh Dil Mange More!' as their
                        success signal</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong> - After capturing Peak 5140, he went for another mission to capture Peak 4875. No
                        doubt it was one of the most difficult missions the Indian army attempted. In the battle, one of his
                        fellow men had been shot. Then, to save him, he took the head and was killed while clearing enemy
                        positions. He was awarded Param Vir Chakra, posthumously, India's highest and most prestigious award for
                        his martyrdom during the Kargil War in 1999 that took place between India and Pakistan.</li>
